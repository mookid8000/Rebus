Contributions are most welcome! :)

I do prefer it if we communicate a little bit before you send PRs, though. This is because I value your time, and it would be a shame if you spent time working on something that could be made better in another way, or wasn't actually needed because what you wanted to achieve could be done better in another way, etc.
